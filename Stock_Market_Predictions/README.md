# Project Overview

In this project, the model predicts if the S&P 500 will close higher or lower the next day. This model has 57% accuracy. This is better than a baseline figure of always guessing the market will go up, which retruns 55% accuracy. This is a modest but signifcant improvemnent.

## Project Steps

* Download data using the yfinance package
* Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy
* Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy
* Improve the accuracy of the model
